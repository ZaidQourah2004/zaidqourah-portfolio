## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was developing an algorithm that could effectively prioritize tasks while respecting the nuances of different user workflows and preferences. Extensive user testing and iterative improvement cycles were necessary to refine the AI recommendations to a point where they genuinely enhanced productivity rather than adding friction. Building an interface that felt intuitive while offering powerful features also required careful balance and design thinking.

## Outcome

The planner has helped users increase their productivity and reduce missed deadlines by providing contextual awareness of their priorities and commitments. User feedback highlights how the application has helped them better manage their time, reduce stress from overcommitment, and maintain clearer focus on high-priority tasks. The analytics have also given users valuable insights into their work patterns, helping them make more informed decisions about how they allocate their time.
